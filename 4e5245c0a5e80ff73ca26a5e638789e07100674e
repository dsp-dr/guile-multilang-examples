Schism WebAssembly Integration

This commit adds Schism, an experimental Scheme→WebAssembly compiler, as a submodule.
Schism enables running Scheme code in browsers by compiling to WebAssembly.

Key Features Integrated:
- Self-hosting compiler (Schism is written in Scheme)
- WebAssembly with experimental features (reference types, tail calls)
- Subset of R6RS Scheme support
- JavaScript runtime integration

The wasm-multilang-bridge.scm example demonstrates:
1. Compilation pipeline: Scheme → WebAssembly
2. Elisp optimization analysis before compilation
3. WASM feature detection (reference types, tail calls, GC)
4. Brainfuck test pattern generation for validation
5. JavaScript runtime bindings generation

This extends our multilanguage compilation beyond Guile's targets to include
WebAssembly, enabling browser-based execution of Scheme code.

Future work could include:
- Actual WASM binary generation
- Integration with WebAssembly GC proposal
- Multi-file compilation support
- Macro system integration
